### Why you might need it  
Many developers just got or bought SMTP server and they used it on the internet. But in local server, the mail might not getting send after using SMTP. So this readymade tool will help them to check the reason behind the error without any coding!  
Formatting email correctly is surprisingly difficult. There are myriad overlapping RFCs, requiring tight adherence to horribly complicated formatting and encoding rules – the vast majority of code that you'll find online that uses the `mail()` function directly is just plain wrong!  
After all these problems, finding the exact error for your local server is a bit hard and here comes this tool.
